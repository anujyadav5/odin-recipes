            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            Brown ground beef and onions in a large skillet over medium heat, 
            crumbling as it cooks, until the beef is no longer pink 
            and the onion is soft, about 5 minutes. Drain if necessary.

            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            Add teriyaki sauce, water chestnuts, pineapple, garlic, 
            and ginger to the skillet; stir to combine. Turn the heat down, 
            and simmer for about 5 minutes.

    <h3>Cook's Note:</h3>
    To speed up meal preparation, use garlic and ginger paste 
    (such as Gourmet Garden® which you can find in the produce 
    section of the supermarket) and frozen chopped onion.
